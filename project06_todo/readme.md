Review this [tutorial](https://strapi.io/blog/how-to-build-a-to-do-app-using-next-js-and-strapi-1) to define the requirements.

The app must be [mobile-first and responsive](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/responsive-styles).

When the project is complete deploy it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/overview).
