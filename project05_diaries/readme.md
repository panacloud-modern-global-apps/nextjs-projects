### Diaries Full Stack App using Next.js and Redux Toolkit with TypeScript

In this project we will be learning to use Redux by building an app that lets users create and manage diaries. We will be building our application using Next.js, Chakra UI and weâ€™ll set up our own API using Next.js not use Mirage as shown in the following project:

[We will follow this Tutorial to define the requirements](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/redux-real-world-application/)
 
In the project we will use Prisma to connect to the Database in the APIs.

We will use two versions of the project one using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and the other [Cockroach DB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-started-cockroachdb/). Both versions will be using Prisma. 

Deploy both the versions on Vercel. 

This Project is very important because up to now we have been doing small projects which focused on only focused limited functionality. This project is the first real-world professional full stack project. In the real-world, we will be doing these kinds of projects. Therefore, give special attention to it.
