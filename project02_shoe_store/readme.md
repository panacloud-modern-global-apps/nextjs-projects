# Shoe Store 

Now build a Shoe Store using Next.js and Chakra UI after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NpGzBEySvI).

In the video they made a Shoe Store using React and React Router, however we will build it using only Next.js

The app must be [mobile-first and responsive](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/responsive-styles).

When the project is complete deploy it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/overview).
